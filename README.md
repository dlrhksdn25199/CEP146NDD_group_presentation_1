## GitHub Best Practices for the Project

- Create a `README.md` file with:
  - Project title, team members name and student number
  - Topic summary
  - Link to YouTube video
  - Final question
- Use GitHub Issues to track tasks (e.g., script writing, editing, voiceover).
- Assign roles clearly and document contributions.
- Commit regularly â€“ avoid a single last-minute upload.
- Create branches and use pull requests if possible.
